# Extending Machete

If you read the introduction of this document, you'd by now know that Machete is much more than simply a parser. Machete can be best described as a package of APIs and frameworks for handling text processing with out-of-the-box support for the healthcare industry. That said, this does not mean that Machete cannot be extended to support other industries or even augmented for greater support of the healthcare industry. This is an important distinction because most parsers can only parse what comes in the box. Soon you find this out first hand and as you make your way through the below sections on:
